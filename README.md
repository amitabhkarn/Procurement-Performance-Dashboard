# Procurement-Performance-Dashboard (Power Bi)
## Overview
This project showcases a Procurement SLA Performance Dashboard developed in Power BI. Previously, there was no single dashboard available for clients to track SLA scores along with monthly and weekly procurement volumes. Reporting was handled in Excel, which was time-consuming and prone to errors. The new Power BI solution provides interactive, accurate, and visually engaging dashboards that improve procurement visibility and reduce manual effort.

## 🛠 Data Sources
The dashboard consolidates SLA raw data from multiple procurement sources:

- <a href = "https://github.com/amitabhkarn/Procurement-Performance-Dashboard/blob/main/Buydesk%20Data%202023.xlsx">Buydesk_PRtoPO</a>
- <a href = "https://github.com/amitabhkarn/Procurement-Performance-Dashboard/blob/main/Buydesk_QC%26RFQ.xlsx">Buydesk_QC&RFQ</a>

## 📈 Key Metrics (7 SLA KPIs)
The dashboard tracks the following procurement SLA metrics:
1. **BD 01.1**  
2. **BD 01.2**  
3. **BD 02**  
4. **BD 03.1**  
5. **BD 03.2**  
6. **BD 05**  
7. **BD 06**

## Each metric includes multiple visuals, such as:
- SLA Scores  
- Monthly & Weekly Volumes  
- Product Category Level Volumes  
- PR Status  
- Quality Errors
